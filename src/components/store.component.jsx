/**

 *      - setValue
 *          x Will create or update values that are specified
 *          x However, if they value has been deleted then an error will 
 *            be thrown
 *      - deleteValue
 *          x A graveyard flag is added to the value, and the previously
 *            stored value is archieved
 *      - recoverValue
 *          x Will remove the graveyard flag and reset the value to the
 *            one that was archieved
 * 
 * Please note that action objects must be formatted as:
 *      {type: [action], [key]: [value]}
 * The reasoning is that the key is calculated with the keys of the Object
 * thus even if the function doesn't take a value any must be passed as it 
 * will be "thrown out" by the GC. This maybe changed eventually.
 * 
 * @param {String} name - Name of the context container
 * @param {Object} stateI - Object containing the initial values of this generic state object
