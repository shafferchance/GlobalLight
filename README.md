## Global Light
The goal here is provide someone with a lightweight solution that will work out of the box all while bringing a high level of customizability to the table.

#### Goals of the library
- Be lightweight and customizable
- Have minimal/negible performance cost
- Ensure that integration is easy
- Function with or without customization

#### Current Tasks
- [x] Bring over current code base
- [ ] Make so single tag controls everything rather than dedicated file
- [ ] Document code thoroughly
- [ ] Integrate into a routing library at some point
- [ ] Integrate IndexedDB for serialization

###### Food for thought
Could Mutation Observers make this better and able to have little user intervention?
How large of a chunk can a Mutation Observer reside over before performance starts taking a hit?
